# Grootan-Login-and-mock-API
Created a Dummy Login that validates email and the password, also the Registration form. The User Details is displayed using the Mock API generated in Beeceptor webpage.

This project is done completely on HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.

Workflow:  

1) Initially, login through a Dummy Login which validates only if the email and password is more than 9 characters.
2) For Login purpose Local Storage is used.
3) After login you will be redirected to home page, where it consists of user name in the table format. Table consists of Student Data.
4) Click on the users to know more details. The details is fetched from Beeceptor using API.
